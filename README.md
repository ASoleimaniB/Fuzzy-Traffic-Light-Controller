# Fuzzy-Traffic-Light-Controller
In a limited project I designed a fuzzy controller to manage a 4-way with 4 traffic lights.
There are two controller, one for determining green or red light and one for determining green time.
I didn't have any real data but I designed a flexible structure for further changes.


A simple fuzzy controller was designed 
you can change the membership functions and rules. Also changing some setting related to traffic light and traffic is provided. 
It is just a simple model. 
You can add real data to this model and devise a complicated controller

This is the exact code I previously uploaded on mathworks: https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47281-fuzzy-traffic-light-controller?s_tid=prof_contriblnk
